<h3>Hobbies</h3>
  <p id="p1"><img src="images/listening to music.jpeg" id="pic1"> 
  One of my favorite things to do in my free time is reading. I enjoy genres such as literary fiction, historical fiction, and thrillers, and right now, I’m reading a literary fiction novel called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch" target="_blank" >The Goldfinch by Donna Tart.</a> Recently, I’ve been learning to play the guitar, which has been challenging but also really fun. The hardest part is training my fingers to press the strings properly, but once I develop calluses, I think it’ll be even more enjoyable to figure out a new part of a song or chord. <span class="highlight"> I also love listening to music </span> — my favorite genre is indie pop, although I enjoy exploring other genres too — and I almost always have an AirPod in, since music helps me focus. When I’m not reading, playing guitar, or studying, I spend time with my friends. Altogether, my hobbies help me relax, <span class="tooltip">destress from school,<span class="tooltiptext">I go to CCA!</span></span> and enjoy my free time. </p>

<h3>My Future</h3>
  <p id="p2"> <img src="images/doctor.webp" id="pic2"> 
  Since I've been young,<span class="highlight">  I’ve always wanted to become a doctor, </span> because I’ve always been fascinated by the human body and how it works. I love the idea of doing something I’m interested in while also interacting with others, rather than living a solitary life. I plan to take courses such as AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and Organic Chemistry so I’ll be ready for medical school. My dream school is <a href="https://ucla.edu" target="_blank"> UCLA</a> and I’m working towards joining their pre-med program. I know it will be difficult to reach that goal, but I’m determined to put in the work and make my dream a reality.</p>

<h3>People around me</h3>
  <p id="p3"><img src="images/boba.webp" id="pic3"> 
  The people around me are really important in my life. My parents are always there to support me, no matter what I’m doing, and I can always count on them to listen and give me advice. My brother, even though he’s young, always knows how to cheer me up after a bad day and makes me laugh when I need it most. I especially enjoy spending time with my friends — they’re all super kind and funny, and I always end up happier after spending time with them. <span class="highlight"> I love getting food with them </span> (we often get <a href="https://www.heytea.com" target="_blank"> boba</a> or <span class="tooltip">fries<span class="tooltiptext"> Luna Grill has the best ones! </span></span>), showing up at their houses randomly, or having sleepovers. Being around my family and friends always reminds me how lucky I am to have such an amazing support system, and I’m so grateful for them.</p>
